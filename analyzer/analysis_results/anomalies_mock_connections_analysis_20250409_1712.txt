   - Destination Devices:
     - MAC Address: de:ad:be:ef:00:01 (Unknown)
     - Manufacturer: Unknown
     - IP Address: 104.20.15.1

2. Communication Details:

   - Source Ports: EPH (ephemeral port > 1024)
   - Destination Ports: 443 (HTTPS), 80 (HTTP)
   - IP Addresses:
     - Source: 192.168.1.150
     - Destination: 104.20.15.1

3. Traffic Volume:
   - Total packet counts (CNT) for each connection:
     - TCP a0:d3:c1:aa:bb:cc to de:ad:be:ef:00:01: 112.0
     - TCP de:ad:be:ef:00:01 to a0:d3:c1:aa:bb:cc: 98.0
     - TCP a0:d3:c1:aa:bb:cc to de:ad:be:ef:00:01: 3.0
     - TCP de:ad:be:ef:00:01 to a0:d3:c1:aa:bb:cc: 1.0

4. Risk Assessment:
   - The anomalous connections involve an unknown device (MAC address de:ad:be:ef:00:01) and uses TCP protocol, which is not in our allowed protocol baseline.
   - The destination IP address (104.20.15.1) is also unknown, and the communication involves both HTTPS (port 443) and HTTP (port 80) protocols.
   - Given the combination of these factors, the risk level for these anomalous connections is HIGH.

5. Recommendations:
   - Block the unknown device (MAC address de:ad:be:ef:00:01) to prevent further unauthorized communication.
   - Monitor the situation and investigate the source of the unknown device and its intentions.
   - Allow the communication between the Apple device (MAC address a0:d3:c1:aa:bb:cc) and the known devices/IP addresses in the network environment.

===== Connection Group 2 Analysis =====
1. Device Identification:
   - Source Devices:
     - Manufacturer (MFG): Dell Inc
     - MAC Address: f8:75:a4:dd:ee:ff
     - IP Address: 192.168.1.55
   - Destination Device:
     - Manufacturer (MFG): UNKNOWN
     - MAC Address: aa:bb:cc:00:11:22
     - IP Address: 192.168.1.20

2. Communication Details:
   - Protocol: UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
   - Source IP Address: 192.168.1.55
   - Source Port: EPH (Ephemeral port > 1024)
   - Destination IP Address: 192.168.1.20
   - Destination Port: EPH (Ephemeral port > 1024)

3. Traffic Volume:
   - Total packet counts for this connection group: 7.0

4. Risk Assessment:
   - The use of an unknown device and UDP protocol in this connection group poses a high risk.
   - UDP is commonly used for unreliable datagram protocols, which can be exploited by attackers to carry out DDoS attacks or exfiltrate data.
   - The involvement of an unknown device further increases the risk, as its purpose and intentions are uncertain.

5. Recommendations:
   - Block this connection group to prevent potential security threats.
   - Investigate the source and destination devices to determine their roles in the network environment.
   - Monitor future connections involving these devices to ensure they adhere to the allowed protocol baseline.

===== Connection Group 3 Analysis =====
**Anomalous Connection Group Analysis**

**Device Identification:**
- The first device is a Raspberry Pi Foundation device with MAC address b8:27:eb:11:22:33.
- The second device is a Hangzhou H3C Technologies Co., Ltd. device with MAC address c2:30:6b:44:55:66.

**Communication Details:**
- Both connections are using UDP protocol.
- The source IP addresses are 192.168.1.30 and 192.168.1.88, respectively.
- The destination IP addresses are 224.0.0.251.
- The source ports are 5353, and the destination ports are also 5353.
- The UDP protocol is commonly used for multicast traffic, which is indicated by the destination IP address being a multicast address (224.0.0.251).

**Traffic Volume:**
- The first connection has a CNT of 15.0.
- The second connection has a CNT of 8.0.

**Risk Assessment:**
- The use of UDP protocol for multicast traffic is not inherently malicious, but it could be used for malicious purposes if the traffic is not properly secured or authenticated.
- The fact that both devices are using the same destination port (5353) and the same multicast address (224.0.0.251) suggests that they may be part of a larger network or system.
- The risk level is assessed as Medium, as further investigation is needed to determine if the traffic is legitimate or not.

**Recommendations:**
- Security personnel should investigate these connections to determine their purpose and origin.
- If the traffic is found to be legitimate, it should be allowed to continue.
- If the traffic is found to be malicious, it should be blocked and further action should be taken to secure the network.

===== Connection Group 4 Analysis =====
**Anomalous Connection Group Analysis**

**Device Identification:**
- Source Device: MAC address 00:15:17:77:88:99, Manufacturer Intel Corporate
- Destination Device: MAC address 12:34:56:78:9a:bc, Unknown manufacturer

**Communication Details:**
- Protocol: ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
- Source IP: 192.168.1.1
- Source Port: Not applicable for ARP
- Destination IP: 192.168.1.150
- Destination Port: Not applicable for ARP
- Purpose of Ports: ARP is used to map IP addresses to MAC addresses, which is essential for communication between devices on a network.

**Traffic Volume:**
- Total packet counts (CNT) for this connection group: 3.0

**Risk Assessment:**
- Risk Level: Low
  - Reasoning: The protocol used is ARP, which is a fundamental protocol for network communication. However, the destination device has an unknown manufacturer, which could potentially indicate a rogue or unauthorized device on the network.

**Recommendations:**
- Monitor this connection closely to ensure it does not exhibit any malicious behavior.
- Consider investigating the source of the unknown device to determine if it is authorized to be on the network.
- If the device is not authorized, block its access to the network and investigate further.

===== Connection Group 5 Analysis =====
**Anomalous Connection Group:**

1. **Device Identification:**
   - Source Device: MAC address a0:d3:c1:aa:bb:cc, Manufacturer Apple, Inc.
   - Destination Device: MAC address 00:15:17:77:88:99, Manufacturer Intel Corporate

2. **Communication Details:**
   - Protocol: ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
   - Source IP: 192.168.1.150
   - Destination IP: 192.168.1.1
   - Source Port: Not applicable (ICMP is a connectionless protocol)
   - Destination Port: Not applicable (ICMP is a connectionless protocol)
   - Purpose of ICMP: Used for network diagnostics and error reporting

3. **Traffic Volume:**
   - Packet Count (CNT): 4.0 packets in each direction

4. **Risk Assessment:**
   - Risk Level: Low
   - Reasoning: The use of ICMP is not inherently malicious, and the traffic volume is relatively low. However, it's important to note that ICMP can be used for network reconnaissance or denial-of-service attacks.

5. **Recommendations:**
   - Monitor this connection to ensure it remains legitimate. If the traffic volume increases significantly or if the communication pattern changes, further investigation may be necessary.

===== Connection Group 6 Analysis =====
1. Device Identification:
   - Source devices:
     - Manufacturer: VMware Inc, MAC address: 00:50:56:ab:cd:ef
   - Destination device:
     - Manufacturer: Arista Networks Inc, MAC address: f0:09:0d:12:34:56

2. Communication Details:
   - Protocol: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
   - IP addresses:
     - Source: 10.0.0.5
   - Ports:
     - Source: EPH (ephemeral port > 1024)
     - Destination: 9999
   - Purpose of the ports: The purpose of the ephemeral port is not known without additional context, as it is dynamically assigned by the operating system for client-side connections. The destination port 9999 is not a standard port and its purpose would need to be determined through further investigation.

3. Traffic Volume:
   - CNT: 25.0 (packet counts for each connection)

4. Risk Assessment:
   - The risk level of these anomalous connections is HIGH due to the following reasons:
     - Unknown device (VMware Inc) and unknown protocol (TCP on ephemeral port)
     - Communication with a device from an unfamiliar manufacturer (Arista Networks Inc)
     - Use of a non-standard destination port (9999)

5. Recommendations:
   - Investigate the source of the traffic from the VMware Inc device and determine its purpose.
   - Block the traffic until it can be confirmed as legitimate or malicious.
   - Monitor the traffic for further analysis and potential threats.

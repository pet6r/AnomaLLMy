===== Connection Group 1 Analysis =====
**Anomalous Connection Analysis Report**

**Connection Group:** TCP a0:d3:c1:aa:bb:cc Apple, Inc.

### Device Identification and Communication Details

* **Manufacturer (MFG):**
	+ **Device Name:** Apple
	+ **MAC Addresses:**
		- 192.168.1.150 (known device)
		- EPH de:ad:be:ef:00:01 (unknown device)
* **Protocols and Ports:**

| Protocol | Source Port | Destination Port | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TCP | 443 | 443 | HTTPS |

### Traffic Volume Analysis

* **Packet Counts:** The CNT field represents packet counts for each connection. While it's not possible to analyze the exact packets sent, we can infer that this connection group is relatively small.

**Risk Assessment**

Based on the protocols used (HTTPS), unknown device (EPH), and the lack of a known manufacturer name, I would classify this anomalous connection as **Medium-Risk**. The presence of HTTPS suggests that there may be sensitive data being transmitted between devices, but without further information, it's difficult to determine the significance.

### Recommendations

Given the medium-risk classification, I recommend the following actions for security personnel:

* **Block:** Close the connection to prevent any potential malicious activity.
* **Monitor:** Continue monitoring the connection group for any suspicious activity in the future.

===== Connection Group 2 Analysis =====
**Anomalous Connection Group Analysis**

### Device Identification

| Device | Manufacturer (MFG) |
| --- | --- |
| Dell Inc |  |

### Communication Details

| Protocol | SRCIP SRCPORT DSTIP DSTPORT | CNT |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UDP | 192.168.1.20:12345 | 2.0 |
| UDP | 192.168.1.55:54321 | 5.0 |

### Risk Assessment

Based on the protocols and communication patterns, I assess the risk level of these anomalous connections as Medium.

* The use of an unknown device (Dell Inc) with a MAC address "aa:bb:cc:00:11:22" suggests that it may be a legitimate device from the same manufacturer, but its exact purpose is unclear.
* The protocol used for communication is UDP, which can be used for various purposes such as data transfer or network testing. However, the lack of a specific port number and the fact that both devices use the ephemeral port EPH makes it harder to determine the purpose of the connection.

### Recommendations

Based on my analysis, I recommend the following actions:

* Investigate Dell Inc's device and its role in the network environment.
* Block any further connections from Dell Inc using UDP protocol with ports above 1024 (e.g., TCP port 443 for HTTPS).

**Additional Insights:**

* The fact that both devices use EPH as their ephemeral port suggests that they may be communicating with each other on a trusted basis, which could indicate a legitimate connection.
* However, the lack of specific information about the purpose of the UDP connections makes it harder to determine whether this is a legitimate communication or an anomaly.

**Conclusion:**

These anomalous connections appear to be related to Dell Inc devices and may be part of a larger network issue. Further investigation is necessary to determine the exact nature of these connections and their potential impact on the network environment.

### Traffic Volume Analysis

| Connection Group | CNT |
|-----------------|-----|
| PROTOCOL        | 15.0 |

The single packet count value of 15 indicates a relatively low volume of traffic for this connection group.

### Risk Assessment

Based on the protocols and devices involved, I would assess these connections as **Low** in risk level.

* The use of UDP (User Datagram Protocol) with no specific protocol designation suggests a simple data transfer without encryption or authentication.
* The involvement of Raspberry Pi Foundation and Hangzhou H3C Technologies Co., Limited is not alarming, as both are widely used IoT devices with varying levels of security configurations.
* However, the fact that both protocols have an ephemeral port (EPH) uses makes it possible for unknown attackers to easily exploit vulnerabilities in these devices.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, I recommend **allowing** these connections:

1. **Block:** Ensure that all Raspberry Pi Foundation and Hangzhou H3C Technologies Co., Limited devices are properly configured with robust security measures (e.g., encryption, authentication) to prevent potential exploitation.
2. **Monitor:** Continuously monitor these connections for any unusual activity or suspicious patterns that may indicate a potential threat.

Please note that this analysis is based on the provided data and should be reviewed and validated by human experts before being implemented in production environments.

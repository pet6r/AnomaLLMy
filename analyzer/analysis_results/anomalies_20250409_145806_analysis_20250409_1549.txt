===== Connection Group 1 Analysis =====
 ### Anomalous Connection Group Analysis:

#### Device Identification:
In this connection group, the devices involved are identified as "UNKNOWN" based on their MAC addresses (c2:30:6b:75:12:d8). The manufacturer names associated with these MAC addresses are also marked as unknown. It's important to note that without further information, it is not possible to definitively determine the exact devices involved.

#### Communication Details:
The protocol used in this communication group is TCP. The source IP address is 192.168.68.68 with an ephemeral port (EPH) of c2:30:6b:75:12:d8, which indicates that it's a client-side port. The destination MAC addresses are f0:09:0d:4d:83:00 and f0:09:0d:4d:83:00 respectively, both belonging to TP-Link Systems Inc. The destination IP addresses associated with these MAC addresses are 192.108.254.114 in both cases. The source ports for the first connection are f0 and 6, while for the second connection they are 443 and 6 respectively. These ports indicate that the communication is likely related to HTTPS traffic as port 443 is typically used for secure connections.

#### Traffic Volume:
The CNT field in this connection group suggests a low volume of traffic, with a count of 2 for each connection. This indicates that there is not an overwhelming amount of data being exchanged between the devices involved in these anomalous connections.

#### Risk Assessment:
Based on the provided information, I would assess the risk level as Medium. While the use of TCP and HTTPS traffic is common and generally considered less suspicious, the unknown nature of the devices and their manufacturers raises some concerns. Additionally, multiple connections from the same device in a short period of time could indicate potential unauthorized or malicious activity. It is important to investigate further and monitor these connections closely to determine if any security breaches have occurred.

#### Recommendations:
Given the unknown nature of the devices involved and their manufacturers, it would be recommended to closely monitor these anomalous connections for any signs of unauthorized or malicious activity. Further investigation should be conducted to gather more information about these devices and their intended use within the network environment. If any suspicious behavior is detected, appropriate actions such as blocking or investigating the connections further can be taken based on the severity of the potential threat.

===== Connection Group 2 Analysis =====
 ### Device Identification:
The devices involved in these anomalous connections are identified as TP-Link Systems Inc with MAC addresses f0:09:0d:4d:83:00 and c2:30:6b:75:12:d8.

### Communication Details:
Both of these devices are using the TCP protocol for their communications. The source IP address is 35.186.224.46, while the destination IP addresses are both 192.168.68.68. However, the source port numbers vary with one being EPH (ephemeral port) 443 and the other being EPH 2.0.

### Traffic Volume:
The CNT field for these connections indicates a packet count of 4.0 for the first connection and 2.0 for the second connection. This means that each connection contains a total of four or two packets, respectively.

### Risk Assessment:
Based on the provided information, it appears that these anomalous connections may pose a medium to high risk level. The reason being is that there are unknown devices involved and they are using ephemeral ports which can often be associated with malicious activities.

The first connection has a higher risk assessment as it uses port 443, which is typically associated with secure communication protocols like HTTPS. However, the fact that it's an unknown device increases the risk since it could potentially be involved in unauthorized or suspicious activities.

Similarly, the second connection also poses a medium to high risk as it is using ephemeral port 2.0. Ephemeral ports are typically used for outgoing connections, but their random nature can make them difficult to identify and monitor effectively. Additionally, the unknown device increases the risk level since it could be involved in unauthorized or suspicious activities.

### Recommendations:
Given the medium to high-risk assessment of these anomalous connections, I would recommend further investigation by security personnel. It is important to gather more information about these devices and their intended purposes within the network. Monitoring these connections closely can provide insights into any potential threats or unauthorized activities associated with them. Additionally, considering blocking these connections if deemed necessary based on further investigation and assessment of the situation.

===== Connection Group 3 Analysis =====
 **Device Identification:**
The devices involved in this anomalous connection group are unknown, as indicated by the "UNKNOWN" value in the SRCMFG and DSTMFG columns. Their MAC addresses are c2:30:6b:75:12:d8 and f0:09:0d:4d:83:00.

**Communication Details:**
The protocol used for these connections is UDP, as mentioned in the PROTOCOL column. The source IP address is 192.168.68.68, and all of the connections use ephemeral ports with the same destination MAC address (f0:09:0d:4d:83:00) and IP address (68.105.28.15).

**Traffic Volume:**
The CNT field indicates that each connection represents a single packet count. Therefore, it seems like there is only one packet transmitted for each communication session.

**Risk Assessment:**
Given the unknown devices and the use of UDP protocols on ephemeral ports, this anomalous connection group poses a Medium risk level. Unknown devices can potentially be malicious actors trying to infiltrate or cause harm to the network, while UDP traffic on ephemeral ports is often associated with port scanning activities or denial-of-service attacks. Further investigation and monitoring of these connections would be necessary to determine if any specific threat exists.

**Recommendations:**
Based on the information provided, I recommend closely monitoring and analyzing these anomalous connections for potential malicious activity. As a precautionary measure, it may also be beneficial to block or restrict these connections until their legitimacy can be verified. If deemed necessary, additional investigation into the devices and their intended communication should be conducted by security personnel.

===== Connection Group 4 Analysis =====
 ### Analysis of Anomalous Connection Group:

#### Device Identification:
The devices involved in this anomalous connection group are all identified as TP-Link Systems Inc, with the MAC addresses starting with "f0:09:0d:4d:83:xx". It seems that these devices have been frequently engaging in outgoing connections on port 53 using UDP protocol.

#### Communication Details:
The protocol used for these connections is UDP, and the IP addresses involved are 68.105.28.15 (the source address) and 192.168.68.68 (the destination address). The ports being used range from EPH (Ephemeral Port High), which is typically associated with client connections, to specific ports such as 33950, 17848, and 10233.

#### Traffic Volume:
The CNT field indicates that the total packet count for each connection in this group ranges from 1 to 1. This suggests a relatively low volume of traffic.

#### Risks Assessment:
Based on the provided information, I would assess the risk level as "Medium". While there is no immediate cause for alarm due to the low traffic volume, the presence of unknown devices and unrecognized protocols raises concerns about potential security vulnerabilities. The use of port 53 also implies a possibility of DNS-related activities, which could potentially be exploited.

#### Recommendations:
Given the identified risks, I would recommend further investigation to determine the nature and purpose of these connections. It may be prudent to monitor these devices more closely for any suspicious behavior or unauthorized access attempts. If necessary, security personnel should consider temporarily blocking these connections until their legitimacy can be confirmed. Regular updates to the baseline detection system will also help in identifying such anomalous activities promptly.

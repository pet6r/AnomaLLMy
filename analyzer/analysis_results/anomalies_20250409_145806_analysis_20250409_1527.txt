===== Connection Group 1 Analysis =====
 ### Analyzing Anomalous Connection Group:

#### Device Identification:
The devices involved in this anomalous connection group are identified as having the MAC address c2:30:6b:75:12:d8 and belonging to the manufacturer UNKNOWN with the manufacturer name "TP-Link Sysetms Inc".

#### Communication Details:
This connection group involves TCP protocol conversations between the devices listed above. The source IP addresses are 192.168.68.68, and the destination IP addresses are both 192.108.254.114 with ports 443 and 6. The ephemeral port (EPH) used by the clients is f0:09:0d:4d:83:00.

#### Traffic Volume:
The CNT field in this connection group indicates that a total of 10 packets were exchanged between the devices involved, suggesting a moderate volume of traffic for these connections.

#### Risk Assessment:
Based on the provided information, I would assess the risk level associated with these anomalous connections as Medium to High. The unknown device and unconventional ports used suggest potential vulnerabilities that may warrant further investigation. It is essential to examine the communication patterns and any known risks associated with the TP-Link systems to determine the specific level of risk.

#### Recommendations:
Considering the risk assessment, it would be prudent for security personnel to take a cautious approach when dealing with these anomalous connections. Depending on the specific context and network environment, recommendations could include monitoring these connections closely to gather more information or blocking them entirely if they pose an unacceptable level of risk. A thorough investigation into the unknown device and its potential security implications is also crucial to ensure the network's overall safety.

===== Connection Group 2 Analysis =====
 ### Device Identification:
The devices involved in this anomalous connection group are both labeled as TP-Link Systems Inc, and their MAC addresses are f0:09:0d:4d:83:00.

### Communication Details:
This anomalous communication occurs using the TCP protocol. The source IP address is 35.186.224.46, and the source port varies between EPH (Ephemeral Port Higher than 1024) for one connection and 443 for the other. The destination MAC address is c2:30:6b:75:12:d8, which is marked as UNKNOWN, and the destination IP addresses are the same in both cases, namely 192.168.68.68. Interestingly, the source port for one connection is also labeled as EPH (Ephemeral Port Higher than 1024), while it is 4.0 and 2.0 for the other two connections respectively.

### Traffic Volume:
The CNT field indicates the packet counts for each connection, but unfortunately, this specific dataset does not provide that information. However, based on the context and the nature of the anomalous behavior, it is worth investigating if these connections represent a significant increase in traffic volume.

### Risk Assessment:
Given the information available, this anomalous connection group poses a medium risk level. The unknown device with the MAC address c2:30:6b:75:12:d8 using a protocol other than the allowed baseline creates an element of uncertainty and potential security vulnerabilities. The fact that the devices involved are from TP-Link Systems Inc is noteworthy but doesn't necessarily indicate any specific risks associated with the manufacturer. However, the lack of information about the destination IP address adds to the overall risk level, as it could potentially be an untrusted or malicious entity.

### Recommendations:
Given the medium-level risk posed by this anomalous connection group, I recommend monitoring these connections closely. It would be prudent for security personnel to keep a close eye on them and investigate their purpose further. If necessary, additional security measures can be taken, such as implementing stricter network access controls or blocking these connections altogether if they prove to be malicious or unauthorized.

===== Connection Group 3 Analysis =====
 Device Identification:
The devices involved in this connection are all identified as unknown devices based on their MAC addresses and manufacturer names. The MAC addresses belong to the OUI c2:30:6b, which is not recognized in our baseline. Additionally, the manufacturers listed as "UNKNOWN" further confirm that these devices are not known to us.

Communication Details:
The protocol used for this connection is UDP. The source IP address (192.168.68.68) is consistent throughout all connections, indicating a persistent communication. The destination MAC addresses (f0:09:0d:4d:83:00) are all associated with the TP-Link Systems Inc., and the source IP address (68.105.28.15) is consistently that of TP-Link. The source port varies, ranging from EPH to specific numbers like 33950, 17848, 10233, and 46726.

Traffic Volume:
The CNT field indicates that there are a total of 10 connections between the unknown devices and the TP-Link system, each with a count of 1 packet. The traffic volume appears to be relatively low, but it still represents an unusual pattern since the same source IP is communicating with the destination multiple times using different ports.

Risk Assessment:
Given the information provided, I would assess the risk level as Medium. While the devices are unknown and their purpose remains unclear, the fact that they are repeatedly connecting to a known system (TP-Link) suggests a targeted or persistent attempt to communicate with it. The use of multiple ports further indicates potential vulnerabilities or attempts to evade detection.

Recommendations:
Given the information at hand, I recommend implementing network monitoring for these connections. It would be beneficial to investigate the purpose and origin of these devices further. Additionally, blocking the communication may be a prudent measure if no legitimate use case can be determined. If there is any known vulnerability associated with the TP-Link system, investigating that aspect would also be crucial. Overall, it's important to approach this situation cautiously and thoroughly analyze the context before taking any further actions.

===== Connection Group 4 Analysis =====
 Device Identification:
The devices involved in this anomalous connection group are TP-Link Systems Inc devices, specifically those with the MAC addresses f0:09:0d:4d:83:00.

Communication Details:
The communication between these devices and the destination is happening through UDP protocol, utilizing ephemeral ports (EPH) above 1024. The source IP address is 68.105.28.15, while the destination IP addresses vary. The source MAC addresses are consistent across all connections, belonging to TP-Link Systems Inc devices.

Traffic Volume:
The CNT field indicates that each connection contains one packet.

Risk Assessment:
Given the protocol and the unknown manufacturer, this anomalous connection group poses a critical risk level. Unknown manufacturers can potentially be malicious actors trying to infiltrate or cause harm to the network infrastructure. Additionally, the use of UDP protocol, especially ephemeral ports (EPH), often indicates an attempt to bypass security measures. Therefore, it is crucial to further investigate and mitigate these connections promptly.

Recommendations:
Based on the information provided, it would be advisable for security personnel to take immediate action to block or restrict these anomalous connections. Given the critical risk level associated with unknown devices and the use of UDP protocol, allowing these connections without further investigation could potentially expose the network to potential threats. It is always better to err on the side of caution when dealing with such suspicious activities.

===== Connection Group 1 Analysis =====
## Anomalous Connection Analysis

**Connection Group:**  Anomalous connections based on unknown device (OUI) and non-allowed protocol usage

**Detailed Insights by Connection Group:**


**Group 1:**

* **Device Identification:**  
    * Unknown Device: The OUI "de:ad:be:ef:00:01" is not in our baseline, indicating a potential newly introduced device or a device with an unusual MAC address. 
    * Manufacturer (MFG): Apple, Inc.  (based on SRCMFG)
    * IP Address: SRCIP - 192.168.1.150; DSTIP - 104.20.15.1
* **Communication Details:**  
    * Protocols: TCP 
    * Ports: 
        * Source (SRCPORT) - 443 for HTTPS traffic
        * Destination (DSTPORT) - 80 for HTTP traffic
    * Other Details: The communication appears to be from an unknown device (OUI) attempting a connection with Apple, Inc. on port 443 and port 80.
* **Traffic Volume:** CNT - 1.0, indicating potentially high frequency of connections, but further analysis is needed for context.
* **Risk Assessment:**   **Medium** 
    * **Reasoning:** The communication protocols (TCP) indicate a possible attack attempt as well as the use of ports such as 443 and 80 that are often used in web traffic. This may be an initial communication or part of a broader attack effort. Further investigation is required to assess risk level accurately.
* **Recommendations:**  **Monitor.** Conduct further analysis on the source and destination IP address, MAC address, and protocol usage to understand if this is malicious activity.

**Group 2:**


* **Device Identification:**
    * Unknown Device (OUI):  No known devices are detected for the DSTMAC in connection group two
    * Manufacturer (MFG): Apple, Inc. 
    * IP Address: DSTIP - 104.20.15.1
* **Communication Details:** 
    * Protocols: TCP
    * Ports: 
        * Source (SRCPORT) - EPH (ephemeral port range > 1024)
        * Destination (DSTPORT) - 443 for HTTPS traffic, and 80 for HTTP traffic.
    * Other Details: This connection appears to be from the unknown device (OUI) attempting a connection with Apple, Inc., possibly a communication attempt with the previous connection.
* **Traffic Volume:**  CNT - 98.0, indicating frequent connections within a specific time frame. Further analysis is required for context. 
* **Risk Assessment:**  **Medium-High**
    * **Reasoning:** While the connection appears to be initiated from an unknown device (OUI), it uses established protocols and ports. However, the volume of traffic suggests an ongoing or persistent attempt to reach Apple, Inc., making this connection risky. 
* **Recommendations:**  **Investigate Further.** If the purpose of these communications is legitimate and non-suspicious, then monitoring should be sufficient. For any suspicious activity, blocking may be required until further investigation is completed.


**Additional Notes**

*  The use of ephemeral ports (e.g., EPH) increases the difficulty in identifying malicious connections. It suggests an attack vector that attempts to obfuscate their true purpose. 
*  Analyzing traffic patterns and protocols can help identify potential attacks or unusual activity within your network environment.
